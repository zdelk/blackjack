# Blackjack in Python
This is a python-base blackjack project for BootDev. The game is run in the command line and has basic game logic. Currently you can only "hit" or "stay". The plan is to add more (i.e. split, double down)

### Requirements
- built in python3
- libraries used: random, time

## To Use
1. clone repo """git clone https://github.com/zdelk/blackjack.git"""
2. run blackjack.py """python3 blackjack.py""

## Todo
[ ] Double down - double bet  
[ ] Split - Creates 2 hands for one player  
[ ] Multiplayer - either multiple real player or create cpu  
[ ] Clean up display (possible gui but more than likely prettier cli)
